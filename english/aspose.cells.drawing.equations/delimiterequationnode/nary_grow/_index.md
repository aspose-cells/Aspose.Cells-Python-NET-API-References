## nary_grow property


Specifies whether the delimiter should automatically expand and contract with the height of the formula.

### Remarks 


This property specifies the growth property of the delimiter at the document level. 
When off, the delimiter will not grow to match the size of its component height. 
When enabled, the delimiter grows vertically to match its component height.
### Definition:
```python
@property
def nary_grow(self):
    ...
@nary_grow.setter
def nary_grow(self, value):
    ...
```
