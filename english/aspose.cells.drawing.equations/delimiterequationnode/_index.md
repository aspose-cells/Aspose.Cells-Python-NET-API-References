## DelimiterEquationNode class

This class specifies the delimiter equation, consisting of opening and closing delimiters (such as parentheses, braces, brackets, and vertical bars), and a component contained inside. 
The delimiter may have more than one component, with a designated separator character between each component.



**Inheritance:** [`DelimiterEquationNode`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/delimiterequationnode) → 
[`EquationNode`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/equationnode) →

The DelimiterEquationNode type exposes the following members:
