## SubSupEquationNode class

This class specifies an equation that can optionally be superscript or subscript.
There are four main forms of this equation, superscript，subscript，superscript and subscript placed to the left of the base, superscript and subscript placed to the right of the base.



**Inheritance:** [`SubSupEquationNode`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/subsupequationnode) → 
[`EquationNode`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/equationnode) → 
[`FontSetting`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/fontsetting)



The SubSupEquationNode type exposes the following members:
