## ArrayEquationNode class

Specifies the Equation-Array function, an object consisting of one or more equations.



**Inheritance:** [`ArrayEquationNode`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/arrayequationnode) → 
[`EquationNode`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/equationnode) → 
[`FontSetting`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/fontsetting)



The ArrayEquationNode type exposes the following members:

### Properties

| [insert_child](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/arrayequationnode/insert_child/#int-aspose.cells.drawing.equations.EquationNodeType) | Inserts a node of the specified type at the specified index position in the current node's child node list. |
| [insert_after](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/arrayequationnode/insert_after/#aspose.cells.drawing.equations.EquationNodeType) | Inserts the specified node after the current node. |
| [insert_before](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/arrayequationnode/insert_before/#aspose.cells.drawing.equations.EquationNodeType) | Inserts the specified node before the current node. |
| [get_child](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/arrayequationnode/get_child/#int) | Returns the node at the specified index among the children of the current node. |
| [remove](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/arrayequationnode/remove/#) | Removes itself from the parent. |
| [remove_all_children](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/arrayequationnode/remove_all_children/#) | Removes all the child nodes of the current node. |
| [create_node](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/arrayequationnode/create_node/#aspose.cells.drawing.equations.EquationNodeType-aspose.cells.Workbook-aspose.cells.drawing.equations.EquationNode) | Create a node of the specified type. |
