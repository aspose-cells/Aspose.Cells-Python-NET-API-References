## ArrayEquationNode class

Specifies the Equation-Array function, an object consisting of one or more equations.



**Inheritance:** [`ArrayEquationNode`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/arrayequationnode) → 
[`EquationNode`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/equationnode) → 
[`FontSetting`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/fontsetting)



The ArrayEquationNode type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/arrayequationnode/type) | Represents the type of the node. |
| [start_index](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/arrayequationnode/start_index) | Gets the start index of the characters. |
| [length](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/arrayequationnode/length) | Gets the length of the characters. |
| [font](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/arrayequationnode/font) | Returns the font of this object. |
| [text_options](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/arrayequationnode/text_options) | Returns the text options. |
| [parent_node](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/arrayequationnode/parent_node) | Specifies the parent node of the current node |
| [equation_type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/arrayequationnode/equation_type) | Get the equation type of the current node |


### Methods

| [`get_child(self, index)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/arrayequationnode/get_child/#int) | Returns the node at the specified index among the children of the current node. |
| [`remove(self)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/arrayequationnode/remove/#) | Removes itself from the parent. |
| [`remove_all_children(self)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/arrayequationnode/remove_all_children/#) | Removes all the child nodes of the current node. |
| [`create_node(, equation_type, workbook, parent)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/arrayequationnode/create_node/#aspose.cells.drawing.equations.equationnodetype-aspose.cells.workbook-aspose.cells.drawing.equations.equationnode) | Create a node of the specified type. |
