## group_chr property


Specifies a symbol(default U+23DF).
It is strongly recommended to use attribute ChrType to set accent character.
Use this property setting if you cannot find the character you need in a known type.

### Remarks 


It should be noted that this property only accepts one character, and if multiple characters are passed in, only the first character is accepted.
### Definition:
```python
@property
def group_chr(self):
    ...
@group_chr.setter
def group_chr(self, value):
    ...
```
