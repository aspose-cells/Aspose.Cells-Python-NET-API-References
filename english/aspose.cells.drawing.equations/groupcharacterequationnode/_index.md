## GroupCharacterEquationNode class

This class specifies the Group-Character function, consisting of a character drawn above or below text, often with the purpose of visually grouping items.



**Inheritance:** [`GroupCharacterEquationNode`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/groupcharacterequationnode)



The GroupCharacterEquationNode type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/groupcharacterequationnode/type) |  |
| [start_index](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/groupcharacterequationnode/start_index) |  |
| [length](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/groupcharacterequationnode/length) |  |
| [font](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/groupcharacterequationnode/font) |  |
| [text_options](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/groupcharacterequationnode/text_options) |  |
| [parent_node](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/groupcharacterequationnode/parent_node) |  |
| [equation_type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/groupcharacterequationnode/equation_type) |  |
| [group_chr](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/groupcharacterequationnode/group_chr) | Specifies a symbol(default U+23DF).<br/>It is strongly recommended to use attribute ChrType to set accent character.<br/>Use this property setting if you cannot find the character you need in a known type. |
| [chr_type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/groupcharacterequationnode/chr_type) | Specify combining characters by type value. |
| [position](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/groupcharacterequationnode/position) | This attribute specifies the position of the character in the object |
| [vert_jc](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/groupcharacterequationnode/vert_jc) | This attribute, combined with pos of groupChrPr, specifies the vertical layout of the groupChr object. Where pos specifies the position of the grouping character, vertJc specifies the alignment of the object with respect to the baseline. |
