## nary_operator property


an n-ary operator.e.g "∑".
It is strongly recommended to use attribute NaryOperatorType to set n-ary operator.
Use this property setting if you cannot find the character you need in a known type.

### Remarks 


It should be noted that this property only accepts one character, and if multiple characters are passed in, only the first character is accepted.
### Definition:
```python
@property
def nary_operator(self):
    ...
@nary_operator.setter
def nary_operator(self, value):
    ...
```
