## NaryEquationNode class

This class specifies an n-ary operator equation consisting of an n-ary operator, a base (or operand), and optional upper and lower bounds.



**Inheritance:** [`NaryEquationNode`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/naryequationnode)



The NaryEquationNode type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/naryequationnode/type) |  |
| [start_index](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/naryequationnode/start_index) |  |
| [length](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/naryequationnode/length) |  |
| [font](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/naryequationnode/font) |  |
| [text_options](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/naryequationnode/text_options) |  |
| [equation_type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/naryequationnode/equation_type) |  |
| [is_hide_subscript](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/naryequationnode/is_hide_subscript) | Whether to display the lower bound |
| [is_hide_superscript](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/naryequationnode/is_hide_superscript) | Whether to display the upper bound |
| [limit_location](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/naryequationnode/limit_location) | This attribute specifies the location of limits in n-ary operators. Limits can be either centered above and below the n-ary operator, or positioned just to the right of the operator. |
| [nary_operator](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/naryequationnode/nary_operator) | an n-ary operator.e.g "∑".<br/>It is strongly recommended to use attribute NaryOperatorType to set n-ary operator.<br/>Use this property setting if you cannot find the character you need in a known type. |
| [nary_operator_type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/naryequationnode/nary_operator_type) | an n-ary operator.e.g "∑" |
| [nary_grow](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/naryequationnode/nary_grow) | This attribute specifies the growth property of n-ary operators at the document level. When off, n-ary operators such as integrals and summations do not grow to match the size of their operand height. When on, the n-ary operator grows vertically to match its operand height. |
