## nary_grow property


This attribute specifies the growth property of n-ary operators at the document level. When off, n-ary operators such as integrals and summations do not grow to match the size of their operand height. When on, the n-ary operator grows vertically to match its operand height.
### Definition:
```python
@property
def nary_grow(self):
    ...
@nary_grow.setter
def nary_grow(self, value):
    ...
```
