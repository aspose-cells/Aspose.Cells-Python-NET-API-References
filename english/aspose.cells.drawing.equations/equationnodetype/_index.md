## EquationNodeType enumeration

Equation node type.
Notice:
(1)[1-99] Currently there is only one node in the scope, and its enumeration value is 1. The node it specifies is used to store mathematical text.
(2)[100-199] Indicates that the node is a component of some special function nodes.
(3)[200-] Indicates that the node has some special functions(Usually with 'Equation' suffix. 'EquationParagraph' is a special case.).



The EquationNodeType type exposes the following members:
