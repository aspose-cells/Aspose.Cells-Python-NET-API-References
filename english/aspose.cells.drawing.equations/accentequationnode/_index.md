## AccentEquationNode class

This class specifies an accent equation, consisting of a base component and a combining diacritic.



**Inheritance:** [`AccentEquationNode`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/accentequationnode) → 
[`EquationNode`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/equationnode) → 
[`FontSetting`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/fontsetting)



The AccentEquationNode type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/accentequationnode/type) | Represents the type of the node. |
| [start_index](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/accentequationnode/start_index) | Gets the start index of the characters. |
| [length](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/accentequationnode/length) | Gets the length of the characters. |
| [font](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/accentequationnode/font) | Returns the font of this object. |
| [text_options](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/accentequationnode/text_options) | Returns the text options. |
| [parent_node](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/accentequationnode/parent_node) | Specifies the parent node of the current node |
| [equation_type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/accentequationnode/equation_type) | Get the equation type of the current node |
| [accent_character](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/accentequationnode/accent_character) | This attribute specifies the type of combining diacritical mark attached to the base of the accent function. The default accent character is U+0302.<br/>It is strongly recommended to use attribute AccentType to set accent character.<br/>Use this property setting if you cannot find the character you need in a known type. |
| [accent_character_type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/accentequationnode/accent_character_type) | Specify combining characters by type value. |
