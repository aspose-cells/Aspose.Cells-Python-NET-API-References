## AccentEquationNode class

This class specifies an accent equation, consisting of a base component and a combining diacritic.



**Inheritance:** [`AccentEquationNode`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/accentequationnode)



The AccentEquationNode type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/accentequationnode/type) |  |
| [start_index](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/accentequationnode/start_index) |  |
| [length](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/accentequationnode/length) |  |
| [font](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/accentequationnode/font) |  |
| [text_options](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/accentequationnode/text_options) |  |
| [parent_node](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/accentequationnode/parent_node) |  |
| [equation_type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/accentequationnode/equation_type) |  |
| [accent_character](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/accentequationnode/accent_character) | This attribute specifies the type of combining diacritical mark attached to the base of the accent function. The default accent character is U+0302.<br/>It is strongly recommended to use attribute AccentType to set accent character.<br/>Use this property setting if you cannot find the character you need in a known type. |
| [accent_character_type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/accentequationnode/accent_character_type) | Specify combining characters by type value. |
