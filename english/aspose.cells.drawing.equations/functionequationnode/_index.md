## FunctionEquationNode class

This class specifies the Function-Apply equation, which consists of a function name and an argument acted upon.
The types of the name and argument components are 'EquationNodeType.FunctionName' and 'EquationNodeType.Base' respectively.



**Inheritance:** [`FunctionEquationNode`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/functionequationnode) → 
[`EquationNode`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.equations/equationnode) → 
[`FontSetting`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/fontsetting)



The FunctionEquationNode type exposes the following members:

### Properties
