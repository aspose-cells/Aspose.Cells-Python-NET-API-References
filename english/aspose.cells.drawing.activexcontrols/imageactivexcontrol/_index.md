## ImageActiveXControl class

Represents the image control.



**Inheritance:** [ImageActiveXControl](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.activexcontrols/imageactivexcontrol) → 
[ActiveXControl](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.activexcontrols/activexcontrol) → 
[ActiveXControlBase](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.activexcontrols/activexcontrolbase)
