### Example 


```python
from aspose import pycore
from aspose.cells import Workbook
from aspose.cells.drawing.activexcontrols import ControlType, SpinButtonActiveXControl

# Initialize a new workbook.
book = Workbook()
# Add a ToggleButtonActiveXControl.
shape = book.worksheets[0].shapes.add_active_x_control(ControlType.SPIN_BUTTON, 1, 0, 1, 0, 100, 50)
activeXControl = pycore.cast(SpinButtonActiveXControl, shape.active_x_control)
# do your business
# Save the excel file.
book.save("exmaple.xlsx")
