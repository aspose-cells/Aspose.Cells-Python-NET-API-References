## LabelActiveXControl class

Represents the label ActiveX control.



**Inheritance:** [LabelActiveXControl](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.activexcontrols/labelactivexcontrol) → 
[ActiveXControl](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.activexcontrols/activexcontrol) → 
[ActiveXControlBase](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing.activexcontrols/activexcontrolbase)



The LabelActiveXControl type exposes the following members:
