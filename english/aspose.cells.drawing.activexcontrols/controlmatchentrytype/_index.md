### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| FIRST_LETTER | The control searches for the next entry that starts with the character entered.<br/>Repeatedly typing the same letter cycles through all entries beginning with that letter. |
| COMPLETE | As each character is typed, the control searches for an entry matching all characters entered. |
| NONE | The list will not be searched when characters are typed. |
