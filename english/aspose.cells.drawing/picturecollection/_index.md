## PictureCollection class

Encapsulates a collection of [`Picture`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/picture) objects.



The PictureCollection type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [capacity](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/picturecollection/capacity) | Gets or sets the number of elements that the array list can contain. |



Gets the [`Picture`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/picture) element at the specified index.
### Indexer
| Name | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [index] | The zero based index of the element. |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`add(self, top_row, left_column, bottom_row, right_column, stream)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/picturecollection/add/#int-int-int-int-io.rawiobase) | Adds a picture to the collection. |
| [`add(self, top_row, left_column, bottom_row, right_column, file_name)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/picturecollection/add/#int-int-int-int-system.string) | Adds a picture to the collection. |
| [`add(self, top_row, left_column, stream)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/picturecollection/add/#int-int-io.rawiobase) | Adds a picture to the collection. |
| [`add(self, top_row, left_column, file_name)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/picturecollection/add/#int-int-system.string) | Adds a picture to the collection. |
| [`add(self, top_row, left_column, stream, width_scale, height_scale)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/picturecollection/add/#int-int-io.rawiobase-int-int) | Adds a picture to the collection. |
| [`add(self, top_row, left_column, file_name, width_scale, height_scale)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/picturecollection/add/#int-int-system.string-int-int) | Adds a picture to the collection. |
| [`copy_to(self, array)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/picturecollection/copy_to/#list) | Copies the entire array list to a compatible one-dimensional array list, starting at the beginning of the target array list. |
| [`copy_to(self, index, array, array_index, count)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/picturecollection/copy_to/#int-list-int-int) | Copies a range of elements from the array list to a compatible one-dimensional array list, starting at the specified index of the target array list. |
| [`index_of(self, item, index)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/picturecollection/index_of/#aspose.cells.drawing.picture-int) | Searches for the specified object and returns the zero-based index of the first occurrence within the range of elements in the array list that extends from the specified index to the last element. |
| [`index_of(self, item, index, count)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/picturecollection/index_of/#aspose.cells.drawing.picture-int-int) | Searches for the specified object and returns the zero-based index of the first occurrence within the range of elements in the array list that starts at the specified index and contains the specified number of elements. |
| [`last_index_of(self, item)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/picturecollection/last_index_of/#aspose.cells.drawing.picture) | Searches for the specified object and returns the zero-based index of the last occurrence within the entire array list. |
| [`last_index_of(self, item, index)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/picturecollection/last_index_of/#aspose.cells.drawing.picture-int) | Searches for the specified object and returns the zero-based index of the last occurrence within the range of elements in the array list that extends from the first element to the specified index. |
| [`last_index_of(self, item, index, count)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/picturecollection/last_index_of/#aspose.cells.drawing.picture-int-int) | Searches for the specified object and returns the zero-based index of the last occurrence within the range of elements in the array list that contains the specified number of elements and ends at the specified index. |
| [`camera(self, row, column, range)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/picturecollection/camera/#int-int-system.string) | Takes a photo of the range. |
| [`binary_search(self, item)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/picturecollection/binary_search/#aspose.cells.drawing.picture) | Searches the entire sorted array list for an element using the default comparer and returns the zero-based index of the element. |



### Example 


```python
from aspose.cells import Workbook

# Instantiating a Workbook object
workbook = Workbook()
# get PictureCollection
pictures = workbook.worksheets[0].pictures
# do your business
# Save the excel file.
workbook.save("result.xlsx")

```
