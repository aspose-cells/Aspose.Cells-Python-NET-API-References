## ThreeDFormat class

Represents a shape's three-dimensional formatting.



The ThreeDFormat type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [bottom_bevel_width](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/threedformat/bottom_bevel_width) | Gets and sets the width of the bottom bevel, or how far into the shape it is applied.<br/>In unit of Points. |
| [bottom_bevel_height](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/threedformat/bottom_bevel_height) | Gets and sets the height of the bottom bevel, or how far into the shape it is applied.<br/>In unit of Points. |
| [bottom_bevel_type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/threedformat/bottom_bevel_type) | Gets and sets the type of the bottom bevel, or how far into the shape it is applied.<br/>In unit of Points. |
| [top_bevel_width](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/threedformat/top_bevel_width) | Gets and sets the width of the top bevel, or how far into the shape it is applied.<br/>In unit of Points. |
| [top_bevel_height](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/threedformat/top_bevel_height) | Gets and sets the height of the top bevel, or how far into the shape it is applied.<br/>In unit of Points. |
| [top_bevel_type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/threedformat/top_bevel_type) | Gets and sets the type of the top bevel, or how far into the shape it is applied.<br/>In unit of Points. |
| [material](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/threedformat/material) | Represents the preset material which is combined with the lighting properties to give the<br/>final look and feel of a shape. |
| [contour_color](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/threedformat/contour_color) | Gets and sets the contour color on a shape. |
| [contour_width](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/threedformat/contour_width) | Gets and sets the contour width on the shape, in unit of points. |

| [extrusion_height](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/threedformat/extrusion_height) | Gets and sets the extrusion height of the applied to the shape, in unit of points. |
| [z](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/threedformat/z) | Defines the distance from ground for the 3D shape. |
| [light_angle](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/threedformat/light_angle) | Gets and sets the angle of the extrusion lights. |
| [lighting](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/threedformat/lighting) | Gets and sets type of light rig. |
| [lighting_direction](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/threedformat/lighting_direction) | Gets and sets the direction from which the light rig is oriented in relation to the scene. |
| [perspective](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/threedformat/perspective) | Gets and sets the angle at which a ThreeDFormat object can be viewed. |
| [rotation_x](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/threedformat/rotation_x) | Gets and sets the rotation of the extruded shape around the x-axis in degrees. |
| [rotation_y](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/threedformat/rotation_y) | Gets and sets the rotation of the extruded shape around the y-axis in degrees. |
| [rotation_z](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/threedformat/rotation_z) | Gets and sets the rotation of the extruded shape around the z-axis in degrees. |
