## ShapePathPoint class

Specify position coordinates or angle markers.
Position coordinates represent the coordinates of a path in a coordinate space (e.g. X/Y). 
Angle markers indicate angular changes in a path (e.g. the start and swing angles of an arc).



The ShapePathPoint type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [x](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shapepathpoint/x) | Gets and sets x coordinate for this position coordinate. Unit EMUs. |
| [y](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shapepathpoint/y) | Gets y coordinate for this position coordinate. Unit EMUs. |
| [x_pixel](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shapepathpoint/x_pixel) | When the object is a position coordinate, get or set the x coordinate in pixels. |
| [y_pixel](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shapepathpoint/y_pixel) | When the object is a position coordinate, get or set the y coordinate in pixels. |
| [x_angle](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shapepathpoint/x_angle) | When the object is an angle marker, get or set the first angle in degrees. |
| [y_angle](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shapepathpoint/y_angle) | When the object is an angle marker, get or set the second angle in degrees. |
| [type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shapepathpoint/type) | Specifies the value type of the current object. |
