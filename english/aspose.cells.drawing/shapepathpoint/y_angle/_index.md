## y_angle property


When the object is an angle marker, get or set the second angle in degrees.

### Remarks 


If this angle is the swing angle of an arc. This angle will specify how far angle-wise along the supposed cicle path the arc will be extended. The extension from the start angle will always be in the clockwise direction around the supposed circle.
### Definition:
```python
@property
def y_angle(self):
    ...
@y_angle.setter
def y_angle(self, value):
    ...
```
