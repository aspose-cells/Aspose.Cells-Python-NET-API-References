## ShapePropertyCollection class

This class specifies the visual shape properties for a chart element or shape.



The ShapePropertyCollection type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [glow_effect](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shapepropertycollection/glow_effect) | Represents a [ShapePropertyCollection.glow_effect](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shapepropertycollection#glow_effect) object that specifies glow effect for the chart element or shape. |
| [format_3d](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shapepropertycollection/format_3d) | Represents a [ShapePropertyCollection.format_3d](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shapepropertycollection#format_3d) object that specifies 3D shape properties for the chart element or shape. |
| [soft_edge_radius](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shapepropertycollection/soft_edge_radius) | Gets and sets the radius of blur to apply to the edges, in unit of points. |
| [shadow_effect](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shapepropertycollection/shadow_effect) | Represents a [ShapePropertyCollection.shadow_effect](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shapepropertycollection#shadow_effect) object that specifies shadow effect for the chart element or shape. |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [clear_glow_effect()](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shapepropertycollection/clear_glow_effect/#) | Clears the glow effect of the shape. |
| [has_glow_effect()](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shapepropertycollection/has_glow_effect/#) | Indicates if the shape has glow effect data. |
| [has_format_3d()](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shapepropertycollection/has_format_3d/#) | Indicates if the shape has 3d format data. |
| [clear_format_3d()](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shapepropertycollection/clear_format_3d/#) | Clears the 3D shape properties of the shape. |
| [clear_shadow_effect()](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shapepropertycollection/clear_shadow_effect/#) | Clears the shadow effect of the chart element or shape. |
| [has_shadow_effect()](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/shapepropertycollection/has_shadow_effect/#) | Indicates if the shape has shadow effect data. |
