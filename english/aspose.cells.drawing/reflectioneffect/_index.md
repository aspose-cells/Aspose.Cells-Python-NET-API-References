## ReflectionEffect class

This class specifies a reflection effect.



The ReflectionEffect type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/type) | Gets and sets the preset reflection effect. |
| [transparency](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/transparency) | Gets and sets the degree of the starting reflection transparency as a value from 0.0 (opaque) through 1.0 (clear). |
| [size](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/size) | Gets and sets the end position (along the alpha gradient ramp) of the end alpha value,in unit of percentage |
| [blur](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/blur) | Gets and sets the blur radius,in unit of points. |
| [direction](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/direction) | Gets and sets the direction of the alpha gradient ramp relative to the shape itself. |
| [distance](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/distance) | Gets and sets how far to distance the shadow,in unit of points. |
| [fade_direction](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/fade_direction) | Gets and sets the direction to offset the reflection. |
| [rot_with_shape](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/reflectioneffect/rot_with_shape) | Gets and sets if the reflection should rotate with the shape. |
