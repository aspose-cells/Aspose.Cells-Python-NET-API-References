| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [__init__](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.numbers/numbersloadoptions/__init__/#) | Constructor. |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [load_format](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.numbers/numbersloadoptions/load_format) | Gets the load format. |
| [password](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.numbers/numbersloadoptions/password) | Gets and set the password of the workbook. |
| [parsing_formula_on_open](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.numbers/numbersloadoptions/parsing_formula_on_open) | Indicates whether parsing the formula when reading the file. |
| [parsing_pivot_cached_records](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.numbers/numbersloadoptions/parsing_pivot_cached_records) | Indicates whether parsing pivot cached records when loading the file.<br/>The default value is false. |
| [language_code](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.numbers/numbersloadoptions/language_code) | Gets or sets the user interface language of the Workbook version based on CountryCode that has saved the file. |
| [region](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.numbers/numbersloadoptions/region) | Gets or sets the system regional settings based on CountryCode at the time the file was loaded. |
| [default_style_settings](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.numbers/numbersloadoptions/default_style_settings) | Gets the default style settings for initializing styles of the workbook |
| [standard_font](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.numbers/numbersloadoptions/standard_font) | Sets the default standard font name |
| [standard_font_size](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.numbers/numbersloadoptions/standard_font_size) | Sets the default standard font size. |
| [interrupt_monitor](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.numbers/numbersloadoptions/interrupt_monitor) | Gets and sets the interrupt monitor. |
| [ignore_not_printed](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.numbers/numbersloadoptions/ignore_not_printed) | Ignore the data which are not printed if directly printing the file |
| [check_data_valid](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.numbers/numbersloadoptions/check_data_valid) | Check whether data is valid in the template file. |
| [check_excel_restriction](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.numbers/numbersloadoptions/check_excel_restriction) | Whether check restriction of excel file when user modify cells related objects.<br/>For example, excel does not allow inputting string value longer than 32K.<br/>When you input a value longer than 32K such as by Cell.PutValue(string), if this property is true, you will get an Exception.<br/>If this property is false, we will accept your input string value as the cell's value so that later<br/>you can output the complete string value for other file formats such as CSV.<br/>However, if you have set such kind of value that is invalid for excel file format,<br/>you should not save the workbook as excel file format later. Otherwise there may be unexpected error for the generated excel file. |
