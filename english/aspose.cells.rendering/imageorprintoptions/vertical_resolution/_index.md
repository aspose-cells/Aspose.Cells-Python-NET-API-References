## vertical_resolution property


Gets or sets the vertical resolution for generated images, in dots per inch.

### Remarks 


The default value is 96.


Setting [`ImageOrPrintOptions.horizontal_resolution`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.rendering/imageorprintoptions#horizontal_resolution) and [`ImageOrPrintOptions.vertical_resolution`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.rendering/imageorprintoptions#vertical_resolution) 
effects the width and height of the output image in pixels.

### Example 


The following code sets resolution to 192, the width and height of the generated image is twice of 
the one with resolution left as the default value 96.

```python
from aspose.cells import Workbook
from aspose.cells.drawing import ImageType
from aspose.cells.rendering import ImageOrPrintOptions

wb = Workbook("Book1.xlsx")
opts = ImageOrPrintOptions()
# Set output image type: png.
opts.image_type = ImageType.PNG
# Set resolution to 192.
opts.horizontal_resolution = 192
opts.vertical_resolution = 192
# Render Chart to image.
wb.worksheets[0].charts[0].to_image("Chart.png", opts)

```
