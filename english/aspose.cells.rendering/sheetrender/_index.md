The SheetRender type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`__init__(self, worksheet, options)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.rendering/sheetrender/__init__/#aspose.cells.worksheet-aspose.cells.rendering.imageorprintoptions) | the construct of SheetRender, need worksheet and ImageOrPrintOptions as params |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [page_count](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.rendering/sheetrender/page_count) | Gets the total page count of current worksheet. |
| [page_scale](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.rendering/sheetrender/page_scale) | Gets calculated page scale of the sheet.<br/>Returns the set scale if [`PageSetup.zoom`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/pagesetup#zoom) is set.
