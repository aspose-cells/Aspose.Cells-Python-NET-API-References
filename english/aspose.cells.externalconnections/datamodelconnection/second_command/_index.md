## second_command property


Specifies a second command text string that is persisted when PivotTable server-based 
page fields are in use. 
For ODBC connections, serverCommand is usually a broader query than command (no 
WHERE clause is present in the former). Based on these 2 commands(Command and ServerCommand),
parameter UI can be populated and parameterized queries can be constructed
### Definition:
```python
@property
def second_command(self):
    ...

def second_command(self, value):
    ...
```
