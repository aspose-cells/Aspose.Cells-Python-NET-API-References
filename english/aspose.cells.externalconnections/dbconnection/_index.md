## DBConnection class

Specifies all properties associated with an ODBC or OLE DB external data connection.



**Inheritance:** [`DBConnection`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection)



The DBConnection type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [id](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/id) |  |
| [connection_id](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/connection_id) |  |
| [class_type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/class_type) | Gets the type of this ExternalConnection object. |
| [power_query_formula](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/power_query_formula) | Gets the definition of power query formula. |
| [type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/type) |  |
| [source_type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/source_type) |  |
| [sso_id](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/sso_id) |  |
| [save_password](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/save_password) |  |
| [save_data](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/save_data) |  |
| [refresh_on_load](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/refresh_on_load) |  |
| [reconnection_method_type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/reconnection_method_type) |  |
| [reconnection_method](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/reconnection_method) |  |
| [only_use_connection_file](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/only_use_connection_file) |  |
| [odc_file](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/odc_file) |  |
| [source_file](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/source_file) |  |
| [connection_file](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/connection_file) |  |
| [is_new](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/is_new) |  |
| [name](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/name) |  |
| [keep_alive](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/keep_alive) |  |
| [refresh_internal](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/refresh_internal) |  |
| [connection_description](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/connection_description) |  |
| [is_deleted](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/is_deleted) |  |
| [credentials_method_type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/credentials_method_type) |  |
| [credentials](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/credentials) |  |
| [background_refresh](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/background_refresh) |  |
| [parameters](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/parameters) |  |
| [command](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/command) | The string containing the database command to pass to the data provider API that will <br/>interact with the external source in order to retrieve data |
| [command_type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/command_type) | Specifies the OLE DB command type. <br/>1. Query specifies a cube name<br/>2. Query specifies a SQL statement<br/>3. Query specifies a table name<br/>4. Query specifies that default information has been given, and it is up to the provider how to interpret.<br/>5. Query is against a web based List Data Provider. |
| [connection_string](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/connection_string) | The connection information string is used to make contact with an OLE DB or ODBC data source. |
| [second_command](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/second_command) | Specifies a second command text string that is persisted when PivotTable server-based <br/>page fields are in use. <br/>For ODBC connections, serverCommand is usually a broader query than command (no <br/>WHERE clause is present in the former). Based on these 2 commands(Command and ServerCommand),<br/>parameter UI can be populated and parameterized queries can be constructed |
| [connection_info](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/connection_info) | The connection information string is used to make contact with an OLE DB or ODBC data source. |
| [sever_command](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/dbconnection/sever_command) | Specifies a second command text string that is persisted when PivotTable server-based <br/>page fields are in use. <br/>For ODBC connections, serverCommand is usually a broader query than command (no <br/>WHERE clause is present in the former). Based on these 2 commands(Command and ServerCommand),<br/>parameter UI can be populated and parameterized queries can be constructed |
