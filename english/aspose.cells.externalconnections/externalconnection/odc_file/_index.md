## odc_file property


Specifies the full path to external connection file from which this connection was 
created. If a connection fails during an attempt to refresh data, and reconnectionMethod=1, 
then the spreadsheet application will try again using information from the external connection file 
instead of the connection object embedded within the workbook.
