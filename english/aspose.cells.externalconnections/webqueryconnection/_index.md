## WebQueryConnection class

Specifies the properties for a web query source. A web query will retrieve data from HTML tables, 
and can also supply HTTP "Get" parameters to be processed by the web server in generating the HTML by 
including the parameters and parameter elements.

| [save_data](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/webqueryconnection/save_data) | True if the external data fetched over the connection to populate a table is to be saved<br/>with the workbook; otherwise, false. |
| [refresh_on_load](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/webqueryconnection/refresh_on_load) | True if this connection should be refreshed when opening the file; otherwise, false. |
| [reconnection_method_type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/webqueryconnection/reconnection_method_type) | Specifies what the spreadsheet application should do when a connection fails.<br/>The default value is ReConnectionMethodType.Required. |
| [reconnection_method](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/webqueryconnection/reconnection_method) | Specifies what the spreadsheet application should do when a connection fails.<br/>The default value is ReConnectionMethodType.Required. |
| [only_use_connection_file](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/webqueryconnection/only_use_connection_file) | Indicates whether the spreadsheet application should always and only use the <br/>connection information in the external connection file indicated by the odcFile attribute <br/>when the connection is refreshed.

| [keep_alive](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/webqueryconnection/keep_alive) | True when the spreadsheet application should make efforts to keep the connection <br/>open. When false, the application should close the connection after retrieving the <br/>information. |
| [refresh_internal](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/webqueryconnection/refresh_internal) | Specifies the number of minutes between automatic refreshes of the connection. |

| [is_deleted](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/webqueryconnection/is_deleted) | Indicates whether the associated workbook connection has been deleted.  true if the<br/>connection has been deleted; otherwise, false. |
| [credentials_method_type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/webqueryconnection/credentials_method_type) | Specifies the authentication method to be used when establishing (or re-establishing) the connection. |
| [credentials](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/webqueryconnection/credentials) | Specifies the authentication method to be used when establishing (or re-establishing) the connection. |
| [background_refresh](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/webqueryconnection/background_refresh) | Indicates whether the connection can be refreshed in the background (asynchronously). <br/>true if preferred usage of the connection is to refresh asynchronously in the background; <br/>false if preferred usage of the connection is to refresh synchronously in the foreground. |
| [parameters](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/webqueryconnection/parameters) | Gets [`ConnectionParameterCollection`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/connectionparametercollection) for an ODBC or web query. |
| [command](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/webqueryconnection/command) | The string containing the database command to pass to the data provider API that will <br/>interact with the external source in order to retrieve data |
| [command_type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/webqueryconnection/command_type) | Specifies the OLE DB command type. <br/>1. Query specifies a cube name<br/>2.

| [second_command](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/webqueryconnection/second_command) | Specifies a second command text string that is persisted when PivotTable server-based <br/>page fields are in use. <br/>For ODBC connections, serverCommand is usually a broader query than command (no <br/>WHERE clause is present in the former). Based on these 2 commands(Command and ServerCommand),<br/>parameter UI can be populated and parameterized queries can be constructed |
| [is_xml](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/webqueryconnection/is_xml) | true if the web query source is XML (versus HTML), otherwise false. |
| [is_xl97](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/webqueryconnection/is_xl97) | This flag exists for backward compatibility with older existing spreadsheet files, and is set<br/>to true if this web query was created in Microsoft Excel 97.<br/>This is an optional attribute that can be ignored. |

| [is_xml_source_data](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/webqueryconnection/is_xml_source_data) | Flag indicating that XML source data should be imported instead of the HTML table itself. |
| [post](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/webqueryconnection/post) | Returns or sets the string used with the post method of inputting data into a web server<br/>to return data from a web query. |
| [is_parse_pre](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/webqueryconnection/is_parse_pre) | Flag indicating whether data contained within HTML PRE tags in the web page is<br/>parsed into columns when you import the page into a query table. |

| [edit_web_page](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/webqueryconnection/edit_web_page) | The URL of the user-facing web page showing the web query data. This URL is persisted<br/>in the case that sourceData="true" and url has been redirected to reference an XML file.<br/>Then the user-facing page can be shown in the UI, and the XML data can be retrieved<br/>behind the scenes. |
| [edit_page](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.externalconnections/webqueryconnection/edit_page) | The URL of the user-facing web page showing the web query data. This URL is persisted<br/>in the case that sourceData="true" and url has been redirected to reference an XML file.<br/>Then the user-facing page can be shown in the UI, and the XML data can be retrieved<br/>behind the scenes. |
