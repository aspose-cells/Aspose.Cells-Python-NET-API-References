## source_file property


Used when the external data source is file-based. When a connection to such a data 
source fails, the spreadsheet application attempts to connect directly to this file. May be 
expressed in URI or system-specific file path notation.
### Definition:
```python
@property
def source_file(self):
    ...
@source_file.setter
def source_file(self, value):
    ...
```
