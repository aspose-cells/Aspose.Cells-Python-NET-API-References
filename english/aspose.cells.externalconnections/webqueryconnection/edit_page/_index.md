## edit_page property


The URL of the user-facing web page showing the web query data. This URL is persisted
in the case that sourceData="true" and url has been redirected to reference an XML file.
Then the user-facing page can be shown in the UI, and the XML data can be retrieved
behind the scenes.

NOTE: This property is now obsolete. Instead, 
please use WebQueryConnection.EditWebPage property.
