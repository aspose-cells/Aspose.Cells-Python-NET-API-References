## ChartCollection class

Encapsulates a collection of [`Chart`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chart) objects.



The ChartCollection type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [capacity](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartcollection/capacity) | Gets or sets the number of elements that the array list can contain. |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [add](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartcollection/add/#aspose.cells.charts.ChartType-int-int-int-int) | Adds a chart to the collection. |
| [add](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartcollection/add/#aspose.cells.charts.ChartType-str-int-int-int-int) | Adds a chart to the collection. |
| [add](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartcollection/add/#bytes-str-bool-int-int-int-int) | Adds a chart with preset template. |
| [add](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartcollection/add/#aspose.cells.charts.ChartType-str-bool-int-int-int-int) | Adds a chart to the collection. |
| [get](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartcollection/get/#int) | Add API for Python Via .Net.since this[int index] is unsupported |
| [get](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartcollection/get/#str) | Add API for Python Via .Net.since this[string Chart] is unsupported |
| [copy_to](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartcollection/copy_to/#list) | Copies the entire array list to a compatible one-dimensional array list, starting at the beginning of the target array list. |
| [copy_to](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartcollection/copy_to/#int-list-int-int) | Copies a range of elements from the array list to a compatible one-dimensional array list, starting at the specified index of the target array list. |
| [index_of](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartcollection/index_of/#aspose.cells.charts.Chart-int) | Searches for the specified object and returns the zero-based index of the first occurrence within the range of elements in the array list that extends from the specified index to the last element. |
| [index_of](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartcollection/index_of/#aspose.cells.charts.Chart-int-int) | Searches for the specified object and returns the zero-based index of the first occurrence within the range of elements in the array list that starts at the specified index and contains the specified number of elements. |
| [last_index_of](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartcollection/last_index_of/#aspose.cells.charts.Chart) | Searches for the specified object and returns the zero-based index of the last occurrence within the entire array list. |
| [last_index_of](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartcollection/last_index_of/#aspose.cells.charts.Chart-int) | Searches for the specified object and returns the zero-based index of the last occurrence within the range of elements in the array list that extends from the first element to the specified index. |
| [last_index_of](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartcollection/last_index_of/#aspose.cells.charts.Chart-int-int) | Searches for the specified object and returns the zero-based index of the last occurrence within the range of elements in the array list that contains the specified number of elements and ends at the specified index. |
| [add_floating_chart](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartcollection/add_floating_chart/#aspose.cells.charts.ChartType-int-int-int-int) | Adds a chart to the collection. |
| [binary_search](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartcollection/binary_search/#aspose.cells.charts.Chart) | Searches the entire sorted array list for an element using the default comparer and returns the zero-based index of the element. |
