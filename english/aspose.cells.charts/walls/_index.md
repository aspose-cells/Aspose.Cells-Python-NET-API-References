## Walls class

Encapsulates the object that represents the walls of a 3-D chart.



**Inheritance:** [`Walls`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/walls) → 
[`Floor`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/floor) → 
[`Area`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/area)



The Walls type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [background_color](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/walls/background_color) | Gets or sets the background Color of the [`Area`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/area). |
| [foreground_color](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/walls/foreground_color) | Gets or sets the foreground Color. |
| [formatting](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/walls/formatting) | Represents the formatting of the area. |
| [invert_if_negative](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/walls/invert_if_negative) | If the property is true and the value of chart point is a negative number,<br/>the foreground color and background color will be exchanged. |
| [fill_format](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/walls/fill_format) | Represents a [`Area.fill_format`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/area#fill_format) object that contains fill formatting properties for the specified chart or shape. |
| [transparency](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/walls/transparency) | Returns or sets the degree of transparency of the area as a value from 0.0 (opaque) through 1.0 (clear). |
| [border](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/walls/border) | Gets or sets the border [`Line`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/line). |
| [center_x](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/walls/center_x) | Gets the x coordinate of the left-bottom corner of Wall center in units of 1/4000 of chart's width after calls Chart.Calculate() method. |
| [center_y](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/walls/center_y) | Gets the y coordinate of the left-bottom corner of Wall center in units of 1/4000 of chart's height after calls Chart.Calculate() method. |
| [width](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/walls/width) | Gets the width of left to right in units of 1/4000 of chart's width after calls Chart.Calculate() method. |
| [depth](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/walls/depth) | Gets the depth front to back in units of 1/4000 of chart's width after calls Chart.Calculate() method. |
| [height](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/walls/height) | Gets the height of top to bottom in units of 1/4000 of chart's height after calls Chart.Calculate() method. |
| [center_x_px](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/walls/center_x_px) | Gets the x coordinate of the left-bottom corner of Wall center in units of pixels after calls Chart.Calculate() method. |
| [center_y_px](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/walls/center_y_px) | Gets the y coordinate of the left-bottom corner of Wall center in units of pixels after calls Chart.Calculate() method. |
| [width_px](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/walls/width_px) | Gets the width of left to right in units of pixels after calls Chart.Calculate() method. |
| [depth_px](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/walls/depth_px) | Gets the depth front to back in units of pixels after calls Chart.Calculate() method. |
| [height_px](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/walls/height_px) | Gets the height of top to bottom in units of pixels after calls Chart.Calculate() method. |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`get_cube_point_count(self)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/walls/get_cube_point_count/#) | Gets the number of cube points after calls Chart.Calculate() method. |
| [`get_cube_point_x_px(self, index)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/walls/get_cube_point_x_px/#int) | Gets x-coordinate of the apex point of walls cube after calls Chart.Calculate() method.<br/>The number of apex points of walls cube is eight |
| [`get_cube_point_y_px(self, index)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/walls/get_cube_point_y_px/#int) | Gets y-coordinate of the apex point of walls cube after calls Chart.Calculate() method.<br/>The number of apex points of walls cube is eight. |
