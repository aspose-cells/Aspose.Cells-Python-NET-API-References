## Trendline class

Represents a trendline in a chart.



**Inheritance:** [Trendline](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/trendline) → 
[Line](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/line)



The Trendline type exposes the following members:

### Example 


```python
from aspose.cells import Workbook
from aspose.cells.charts import ChartType, TrendlineType

# Instantiating a Workbook object
workbook = Workbook()
# Adding a new worksheet to the Excel object
sheetIndex = workbook.worksheets.add()
# Obtaining the reference of the newly added worksheet by passing its sheet index
worksheet = workbook.worksheets[sheetIndex]
# Adding a sample value to "A1" cell
worksheet.cells.get("A1").put_value(50)
# Adding a sample value to "A2" cell
worksheet.cells.get("A2").put_value(100)
# Adding a sample value to "A3" cell
worksheet.cells.get("A3").put_value(150)
# Adding a sample value to "A4" cell
worksheet.cells.get("A4").put_value(200)
# Adding a sample value to "B1" cell
worksheet.cells.get("B1").put_value(60)
# Adding a sample value to "B2" cell
worksheet.cells.get("B2").put_value(32)
# Adding a sample value to "B3" cell
worksheet.cells.get("B3").put_value(50)
# Adding a sample value to "B4" cell
worksheet.cells.get("B4").put_value(40)
# Adding a sample value to "C1" cell as category data
worksheet.cells.get("C1").put_value("Q1")
# Adding a sample value to "C2" cell as category data
worksheet.cells.get("C2").put_value("Q2")
# Adding a sample value to "C3" cell as category data
worksheet.cells.get("C3").put_value("Y1")
# Adding a sample value to "C4" cell as category data
worksheet.cells.get("C4").put_value("Y2")
# Adding a chart to the worksheet
chartIndex = worksheet.charts.add(ChartType.COLUMN, 5, 0, 15, 5)
# Accessing the instance of the newly added chart
chart = worksheet.charts[chartIndex]
# Adding NSeries (chart data source) to the chart ranging from "A1" cell to "B4"
chart.n_series.add("A1:B4", True)
# Setting the data source for the category data of NSeries
chart.n_series.category_data = "C1:C4"
# adding a linear trendline
index = chart.n_series[0].trend_lines.add(TrendlineType.LINEAR)
trendline = chart.n_series[0].trend_lines[index]
# Setting the custom name of the trendline.
trendline.name = "Linear"
# Displaying the equation on chart
trendline.display_equation = True
# Displaying the R-Squared value on chart
trendline.display_r_squared = True
# Saving the Excel file
workbook.save("book1.xls")
