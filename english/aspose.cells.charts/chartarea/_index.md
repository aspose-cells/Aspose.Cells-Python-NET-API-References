## ChartArea class

Encapsulates the object that represents the chart area in the worksheet.



**Inheritance:** [`ChartArea`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartarea) → 
[`ChartFrame`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartframe)



The ChartArea type exposes the following members:

### Properties

| [is_default_pos_be_set](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartarea/is_default_pos_be_set) | Indicates whether default position(DefaultX, DefaultY, DefaultWidth and DefaultHeight) are set. |
| [default_x](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartarea/default_x) | Represents x of default position in units of 1/4000 of the chart area. |
| [default_y](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartarea/default_y) | Represents y of default position in units of 1/4000 of the chart area. |
| [default_width](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartarea/default_width) | Represents width of default position in units of 1/4000 of the chart area. |
| [default_height](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartarea/default_height) | Represents height of default position in units of 1/4000 of the chart area. |

### Example 


```python
from aspose.cells import Workbook
from aspose.cells.charts import ChartType
from aspose.pydrawing import Color

# Instantiating a Workbook object
workbook = Workbook()
# Obtaining the reference of the first worksheet
worksheet = workbook.worksheets[0]
# Adding a sample value to "A1" cell
worksheet.cells.get("A1").put_value(50)
# Adding a sample value to "A2" cell
worksheet.cells.get("A2").put_value(100)
# Adding a sample value to "A3" cell
worksheet.cells.get("A3").put_value(150)
# Adding a sample value to "B1" cell
worksheet.cells.get("B1").put_value(60)
# Adding a sample value to "B2" cell
worksheet.cells.get("B2").put_value(32)
# Adding a sample value to "B3" cell
worksheet.cells.get("B3").put_value(50)
# Adding a chart to the worksheet
chartIndex = worksheet.charts.add(ChartType.COLUMN, 5, 0, 15, 5)
# Accessing the instance of the newly added chart
chart = worksheet.charts[chartIndex]
# Adding NSeries (chart data source) to the chart ranging from "A1" cell to "B3"
chart.n_series.add("A1:B3", True)
# Getting Chart Area
chartArea = chart.chart_area
# Setting the foreground color of the chart area
chartArea.area.foreground_color = Color.yellow
# Setting Chart Area Shadow
chartArea.shadow = True
# Saving the Excel file
workbook.save("book1.xls")
