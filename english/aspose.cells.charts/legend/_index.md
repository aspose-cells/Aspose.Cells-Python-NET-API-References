## Legend class

Encapsulates the object that represents the chart legend.



**Inheritance:** [Legend](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/legend) → 
[ChartTextFrame](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/charttextframe) → 
[ChartFrame](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartframe)



The Legend type exposes the following members:

| [is_default_pos_be_set](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/legend/is_default_pos_be_set) | Indicates whether default position(DefaultX, DefaultY, DefaultWidth and DefaultHeight) are set. |
| [default_x](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/legend/default_x) | Represents x of default position |
| [default_y](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/legend/default_y) | Represents y of default position |
| [default_width](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/legend/default_width) | Represents width of default position |
| [default_height](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/legend/default_height) | Represents height of default position |

### Example 


```python
from aspose.cells import Workbook
from aspose.cells.charts import ChartType, LegendPositionType

workbook = Workbook()
sheet = workbook.worksheets[0]
cells = sheet.cells
cells.get(0, 1).put_value("Income")
cells.get(1, 0).put_value("Company A")
cells.get(2, 0).put_value("Company B")
cells.get(3, 0).put_value("Company C")
cells.get(1, 1).put_value(10000)
cells.get(2, 1).put_value(20000)
cells.get(3, 1).put_value(30000)
chartIndex = sheet.charts.add(ChartType.COLUMN, 9, 9, 21, 15)
chart = sheet.charts[chartIndex]
chart.set_chart_data_range("A1:B4", True)
# Set Legend's width and height
legend = chart.legend
# Legend is at right side of chart by default.
# If the legend is at left or right side of the chart, setting Legend.X property will not take effect.
# If the legend is at top or bottom side of the chart, setting Legend.Y property will not take effect.
legend.y = 1500
legend.width = 50
legend.height = 50
# Set legend's position
legend.position = LegendPositionType.LEFT
