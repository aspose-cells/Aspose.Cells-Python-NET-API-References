### Example 


The following codes show how to create a chart with .Net codes.

```python
from aspose.cells import Workbook
from aspose.cells.charts import ChartType

workbook = Workbook()
sheet = workbook.worksheets[0]
cells = sheet.cells
cells.get(0, 1).put_value("Income")
cells.get(1, 0).put_value("Company A")
cells.get(2, 0).put_value("Company B")
cells.get(3, 0).put_value("Company C")
cells.get(1, 1).put_value(10000)
cells.get(2, 1).put_value(20000)
cells.get(3, 1).put_value(30000)
chartIndex = sheet.charts.add(ChartType.COLUMN, 9, 9, 21, 15)
chart = sheet.charts[chartIndex]
chart.set_chart_data_range("A1:B4", True)
chart.show_legend = True
chart.title.text = "Income Analysis"

```
