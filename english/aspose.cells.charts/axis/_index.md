## Axis class

Encapsulates the object that represents a chart's axis.



The Axis type exposes the following members:

### Example 


```python
from aspose.cells import Workbook
from aspose.cells.charts import ChartType, CrossType

# Instantiating a Workbook object
workbook = Workbook()
# Adding a new worksheet to the Excel object
sheetIndex = workbook.worksheets.add()
# Obtaining the reference of the newly added worksheet by passing its sheet index
worksheet = workbook.worksheets[sheetIndex]
# Adding a sample value to "A1" cell
worksheet.cells.get("A1").put_value(50)
# Adding a sample value to "A2" cell
worksheet.cells.get("A2").put_value(100)
# Adding a sample value to "A3" cell
worksheet.cells.get("A3").put_value(150)
# Adding a sample value to "B1" cell
worksheet.cells.get("B1").put_value(4)
# Adding a sample value to "B2" cell
worksheet.cells.get("B2").put_value(20)
# Adding a sample value to "B3" cell
worksheet.cells.get("B3").put_value(50)
# Adding a chart to the worksheet
chartIndex = worksheet.charts.add(ChartType.COLUMN, 5, 0, 25, 5)
# Accessing the instance of the newly added chart
chart = worksheet.charts[chartIndex]
# Adding NSeries (chart data source) to the chart ranging from "A1" cell to "B3"
chart.n_series.add("A1:B3", True)
# Set the max value of value axis
chart.value_axis.max_value = 200
# Set the min value of value axis
chart.value_axis.min_value = 0
# Set the major unit
chart.value_axis.major_unit = 25
# Category(X) axis crosses at the maxinum value.
chart.value_axis.cross_type = CrossType.MAXIMUM
# Set he number of categories or series between tick-mark labels.
chart.category_axis.tick_label_spacing = 2
# do your business
# Saving the Excel file
workbook.save("book1.xlsx")
