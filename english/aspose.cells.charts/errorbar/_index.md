## ErrorBar class

Represents error bar of data series.



**Inheritance:** [`ErrorBar`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/errorbar) → 
[`Line`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/line)



The ErrorBar type exposes the following members:

| [color](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/errorbar/color) | Represents the Color of the line. |
| [transparency](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/errorbar/transparency) | Returns or sets the degree of transparency of the line as a value from 0.0 (opaque) through 1.0 (clear). |
| [style](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/errorbar/style) | Represents the style of the line. |
| [weight](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/errorbar/weight) | Gets or sets the [`WeightType`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.drawing/weighttype) of the line. |
| [weight_pt](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/errorbar/weight_pt) | Gets or sets the weight of the line in unit of points. |

| [amount](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/errorbar/amount) | Represents amount of error bar.<br/> The amount must be greater than or equal to zero. |
| [show_marker_t_top](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/errorbar/show_marker_t_top) | Indicates if formatting error bars with a T-top. |
| [plus_value](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/errorbar/plus_value) | Represents positive error amount when error bar type is Custom. |
| [minus_value](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/errorbar/minus_value) | Represents negative error amount when error bar type is Custom. |



### Example 


```python
from aspose.cells import Workbook
from aspose.cells.charts import ChartType, ErrorBarDisplayType, ErrorBarType

workbook = Workbook()
cells = workbook.worksheets[0].cells
cells.get("a1").put_value(2)
cells.get("a2").put_value(5)
cells.get("a3").put_value(3)
cells.get("a4").put_value(6)
cells.get("b1").put_value(4)
cells.get("b2").put_value(3)
cells.get("b3").put_value(6)
cells.get("b4").put_value(7)
cells.get("C1").put_value("Q1")
cells.get("C2").put_value("Q2")
cells.get("C3").put_value("Y1")
cells.get("C4").put_value("Y2")
chartIndex = workbook.worksheets[0].charts.add(ChartType.COLUMN, 11, 0, 27, 10)
chart = workbook.worksheets[0].charts[chartIndex]
chart.n_series.add("A1:B4", True)
chart.n_series.category_data = "C1:C4"
for i in range(len(chart.n_series)):
    aseries = chart.n_series[i]
    aseries.y_error_bar.display_type = ErrorBarDisplayType.MINUS
    aseries.y_error_bar.type = ErrorBarType.FIXED_VALUE
    aseries.y_error_bar.amount = 5.0
