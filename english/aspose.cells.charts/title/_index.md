## Title class

Encapsulates the object that represents the title of chart or axis.



**Inheritance:** [`Title`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/title) → 
[`ChartTextFrame`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/charttextframe) → 
[`ChartFrame`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartframe)



The Title type exposes the following members:
