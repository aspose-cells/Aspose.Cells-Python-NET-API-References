# Adding a chart to the worksheet
chartIndex = worksheet.charts.add(ChartType.COLUMN, 5, 0, 15, 5)
# Accessing the instance of the newly added chart
chart = worksheet.charts[chartIndex]
# Adding NSeries (chart data source) to the chart ranging from "A1" cell to "B4"
seriesIndex = chart.n_series.add("A1:B4", True)
# Setting the data source for the category data of NSeries
chart.n_series.category_data = "C1:C4"
series = chart.n_series[seriesIndex]
# Setting the values of the series.
series.values = "=B1:B4"
# Changing the chart type of the series.
series.type = ChartType.LINE
# Setting marker properties.
series.marker.marker_style = ChartMarkerType.CIRCLE
series.marker.foreground_color_set_type = FormattingType.AUTOMATIC
series.marker.foreground_color = Color.black
series.marker.background_color_set_type = FormattingType.AUTOMATIC
