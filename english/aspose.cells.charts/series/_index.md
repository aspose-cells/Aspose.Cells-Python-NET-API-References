chart = worksheet.charts[chartIndex]
# Adding NSeries (chart data source) to the chart ranging from "A1" cell to "B4"
seriesIndex = chart.n_series.add("A1:B4", True)
# Setting the data source for the category data of NSeries
chart.n_series.category_data = "C1:C4"
series = chart.n_series[seriesIndex]
# Setting the values of the series.
series.values = "=B1:B4"
