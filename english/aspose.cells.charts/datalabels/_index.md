## DataLabels class

Encapsulates a collection of all the DataLabel objects for the specified Series.



**Inheritance:** [`DataLabels`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/datalabels) → 
[`ChartTextFrame`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/charttextframe) → 
[`ChartFrame`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.charts/chartframe)

from aspose.cells.charts import LabelPositionType

# Set the DataLabels in the chart
wb = Workbook("chart.xlsx")
chart = wb.worksheets[0].charts[0]
for i in range(len(chart.n_series)):
    datalabels = chart.n_series[i].data_labels
    # Set the position of DataLabels
    datalabels.position = LabelPositionType.INSIDE_BASE
