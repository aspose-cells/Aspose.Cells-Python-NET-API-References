## start_sheet {#int}

Starts to save a worksheet.


### Returns 


true if this provider will provide data for the given sheet; false if given sheet should use its normal data model(Cells).


```python
def start_sheet(self, sheet_index):
    ...
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| sheet_index | int | index of current sheet to be saved. |
### Remarks

It will be called at the beginning of saving a worksheet during saving a workbook.
If the provider needs to refer to *`sheetIndex`*  later
in startRow(Row) or startCell(Cell) method,
that is, if the process needs to know which worksheet is being processed, 
the implementation should retain the *`sheetIndex`*  value here.
