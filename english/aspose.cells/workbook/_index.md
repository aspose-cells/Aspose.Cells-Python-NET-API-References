### Remarks 


The Workbook class denotes an Excel spreadsheet. Each spreadsheet can contain multiple worksheets.
The basic feature of the class is to open and save native excel files.
The class has some advanced features like copying data from other Workbooks, combining two Workbooks, converting Excel to PDF, rendering Excel to image and protecting the Excel spreadsheet.

### Example 


The following example loads a Workbook from an Excel file named designer.xls and makes the horizontal and vertical scroll bars invisible.
It then replaces two string values with an Integer value and string value respectively within the spreadsheet and finally save the workbook as Excel xlsx file. 

```python
from aspose.cells import Workbook

# Open a designer file
designerFile = "designer.xls"
workbook = Workbook(designerFile)
# Set scroll bars
workbook.settings.is_h_scroll_bar_visible = False
workbook.settings.is_v_scroll_bar_visible = False
# Replace the placeholder string with new values
newInt = 100
workbook.replace("OldInt", newInt)
newString = "Hello!"
workbook.replace("OldString", newString)
workbook.save("result.xlsx")

```
