## start_access_cache(self, opts) {#aspose.cells.AccessCacheOptions}

Starts the session that uses caches to access data.



```python

def start_access_cache(self, opts):
    ...
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| opts | [`AccessCacheOptions`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/accesscacheoptions) | options of data access |
### Remarks

If the cache of specified data access requires some data models in worksheet to be "read-only",
then corresponding data models in every worksheet in this workbook will be taken as "read-only"
and user should not change any of them.


After finishing the access to the data, [`Workbook.close_access_cache`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/workbook/close_access_cache) should
be invoked with same options to clear all caches and recover normal access mode.
