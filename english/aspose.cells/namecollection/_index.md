## NameCollection class

Represents a collection of all the [`Name`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/name) objects in the spreadsheet.



The NameCollection type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [capacity](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/namecollection/capacity) | Gets or sets the number of elements that the array list can contain. |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [get](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/namecollection/get/#int) | Add API for Python Via .Net.since this[int index] is unsupported |
| [get](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/namecollection/get/#str) | Add API for Python Via .Net.since this[string text] is unsupported |
| [copy_to](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/namecollection/copy_to/#list) | Copies the entire array list to a compatible one-dimensional array list, starting at the beginning of the target array list. |
| [copy_to](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/namecollection/copy_to/#int-list-int-int) | Copies a range of elements from the array list to a compatible one-dimensional array list, starting at the specified index of the target array list. |
| [index_of](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/namecollection/index_of/#aspose.cells.Name-int) | Searches for the specified object and returns the zero-based index of the first occurrence within the range of elements in the array list that extends from the specified index to the last element. |
| [index_of](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/namecollection/index_of/#aspose.cells.Name-int-int) | Searches for the specified object and returns the zero-based index of the first occurrence within the range of elements in the array list that starts at the specified index and contains the specified number of elements. |
| [last_index_of](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/namecollection/last_index_of/#aspose.cells.Name) | Searches for the specified object and returns the zero-based index of the last occurrence within the entire array list. |
| [last_index_of](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/namecollection/last_index_of/#aspose.cells.Name-int) | Searches for the specified object and returns the zero-based index of the last occurrence within the range of elements in the array list that extends from the first element to the specified index. |
| [last_index_of](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/namecollection/last_index_of/#aspose.cells.Name-int-int) | Searches for the specified object and returns the zero-based index of the last occurrence within the range of elements in the array list that contains the specified number of elements and ends at the specified index. |
| [add](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/namecollection/add/#str) | Defines a new name. |
| [filter](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/namecollection/filter/#aspose.cells.NameScopeType-int) | Gets all defined name by scope. |
| [remove_duplicate_names](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/namecollection/remove_duplicate_names/#) | Remove the duplicate defined names |
| [binary_search](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/namecollection/binary_search/#aspose.cells.Name) | Searches the entire sorted array list for an element using the default comparer and returns the zero-based index of the element. |
