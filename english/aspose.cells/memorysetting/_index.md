## MemorySetting enumeration

Memory usage options.



The MemorySetting type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| NORMAL | Default option for cells model. |
| MEMORY_PREFERENCE | Memory performance preferrable.<br/>With this option the data will be held in compact format so for common scenarios it may give lower memory cost.<br/>However, this option also may degrade R/W performance a bit in some special cases. |
