## max_data_row property


Maximum row index of cell which contains data.

### Remarks 


Return -1 if there is no cell which contains data.
This property needs to iterate and check cells and rows dynamically,
so it is a time-consumed progress and should not be invoked repeatedly,
such as using it directly as condition in a loop.
### Definition:
```python
@property
def max_data_row(self):
    ...
```
