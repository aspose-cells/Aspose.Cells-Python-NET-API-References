## max_data_column property


Maximum column index of cell which contains data.

### Remarks 


-1 will be returned if there is no cell which contains data.
This property needs to iterate and check all cells in a worksheet,
so it is a time-consumed progress and should not be invoked repeatedly.
### Definition:
```python
@property
def max_data_column(self):
    ...
```
