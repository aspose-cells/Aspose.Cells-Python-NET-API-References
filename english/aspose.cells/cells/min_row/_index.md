## min_row property


Minimum row index of cell which contains data or style.

### Remarks 


This property needs to iterate and check cells and rows dynamically,
so it is a time-consumed progress and should not be invoked repeatedly,
such as using it directly as condition in a loop.
### Definition:
```python
@property
def min_row(self):
    ...
```
