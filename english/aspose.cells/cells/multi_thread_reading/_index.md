## multi_thread_reading property


Gets or sets whether the cells data model should support Multi-Thread reading.
Default value of this property is false.

### Remarks 


If there are multiple threads to read Row/Cell objects in this collection concurrently,
this property should be set as true, otherwise unexpected result may be produced.
Supporting Multi-Thread reading may degrade the performance for accessing Row/Cell objects from this collection.
Please note, some features cannot support Multi-Thread reading,
such as formatting values(by [`Cell.string_value`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cell#string_value), [`Cell.display_string_value`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cell#display_string_value), .etc.).
So, even with this property being set as true, those APIs still may give unexpected result for Multi-Thread reading.
### Definition:
```python
@property
def multi_thread_reading(self):
    ...
@multi_thread_reading.setter
def multi_thread_reading(self, value):
    ...
