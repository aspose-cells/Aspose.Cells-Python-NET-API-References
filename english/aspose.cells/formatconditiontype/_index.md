## FormatConditionType enumeration

Conditional format rule type.



The FormatConditionType type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| CELL_VALUE | This conditional formatting rule compares a cell value<br/>to a formula calculated result, using an operator. |
| EXPRESSION | This conditional formatting rule contains a formula to<br/>evaluate. When the formula result is true, the cell is<br/>highlighted. |
| TOP10 | This conditional formatting rule highlights cells whose<br/>values fall in the top N or bottom N bracket, as<br/>specified. |
| UNIQUE_VALUES | This conditional formatting rule highlights unique<br/>values in the range. |
| DUPLICATE_VALUES | This conditional formatting rule highlights duplicated<br/>values. |
| CONTAINS_TEXT | This conditional formatting rule highlights cells<br/>containing given text. Equivalent to using the SEARCH()<br/>sheet function to determine whether the cell contains<br/>the text. |
| NOT_CONTAINS_TEXT | This conditional formatting rule highlights cells that<br/>do not contain given text. Equivalent of using SEARCH()<br/>sheet function to determine whether the cell contains<br/>the text or not. |
| BEGINS_WITH | This conditional formatting rule highlights cells in the<br/>range that begin with the given text. Equivalent to<br/>using the LEFT() sheet function and comparing values. |
| ENDS_WITH | This conditional formatting rule highlights cells ending<br/>with given text. Equivalent to using the RIGHT() sheet<br/>function and comparing values. |
| CONTAINS_BLANKS | This conditional formatting rule highlights cells that<br/>are completely blank. Equivalent of using LEN(TRIM()).<br/>This means that if the cell contains only characters<br/>that TRIM() would remove, then it is considered blank.<br/>An empty cell is also considered blank. |
| NOT_CONTAINS_BLANKS | This conditional formatting rule highlights cells that<br/>are not blank. Equivalent of using LEN(TRIM()). This<br/>means that if the cell contains only characters that<br/>TRIM() would remove, then it is considered blank. An<br/>empty cell is also considered blank. |
| CONTAINS_ERRORS | This conditional formatting rule highlights cells with<br/>formula errors. Equivalent to using ISERROR() sheet<br/>function to determine if there is a formula error. |
| NOT_CONTAINS_ERRORS | This conditional formatting rule highlights cells<br/>without formula errors. Equivalent to using ISERROR()<br/>sheet function to determine if there is a formula error. |
| TIME_PERIOD | This conditional formatting rule highlights cells<br/>containing dates in the specified time period. The<br/>underlying value of the cell is evaluated, therefore the<br/>cell does not need to be formatted as a date to be<br/>evaluated. For example, with a cell containing the<br/>value 38913 the conditional format shall be applied if<br/>the rule requires a value of 7/14/2006. |
| ABOVE_AVERAGE | This conditional formatting rule highlights cells that<br/>are above or below the average for all values in the<br/>range. |
| COLOR_SCALE | This conditional formatting rule creates a gradated<br/>color scale on the cells. |
| DATA_BAR | This conditional formatting rule displays a gradated<br/>data bar in the range of cells. |
| ICON_SET | This conditional formatting rule applies icons to cells<br/>according to their values. |
