### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [get_cell_by_index](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/row/get_cell_by_index/#int) | Get the cell by specific index in the cells collection of this row. |
| [get_enumerator](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/row/get_enumerator/#bool-bool) | Gets an enumerator that iterates cells through this row. |
| [get_cell_or_null](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/row/get_cell_or_null/#int) | Gets the cell or null in the specific index. |
| [get_style](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/row/get_style/#) | Gets the style of this row. |

### Example 


```python
from aspose.cells import BackgroundType, StyleFlag, Workbook
from aspose.pydrawing import Color

# Instantiating a Workbook object
workbook = Workbook()
# Obtaining the reference of the first worksheet
worksheet = workbook.worksheets[0]
style = workbook.create_style()
# Setting the background color to Blue
style.background_color = Color.blue
# Setting the foreground color to Red
style.foreground_color = Color.red
# setting Background Pattern
style.pattern = BackgroundType.DIAGONAL_STRIPE
# New Style Flag
styleFlag = StyleFlag()
# Set All Styles
styleFlag.all = True
# Get first row
row = worksheet.cells.rows[0]
# Apply Style to first row
row.apply_style(style, styleFlag)
# Saving the Excel file
workbook.save("book1.xls")
