## calculate_formula(formula) {#str}

Calculates a formula.


### Returns 


Calculated formula result.


```python
def calculate_formula(self, formula):
    ...

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| formula | str | Formula to be calculated. |


## calculate_formula(formula, opts) {#str-CalculationOptions}

Calculates a formula.


### Returns 


Calculated formula result.


```python
def calculate_formula(self, formula, opts):
    ...
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| formula | str | Formula to be calculated. |
| opts | [CalculationOptions](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/calculationoptions) | Options for calculating formula |


## calculate_formula(options, recursive) {#CalculationOptions-bool}

Calculates all formulas in this worksheet.



```python
def calculate_formula(self, options, recursive):
    ...
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| options | [CalculationOptions](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/calculationoptions) | Options for calculation |
| recursive | bool | True means if the worksheet' cells depend on the cells of other worksheets,<br/>the dependent cells in other worksheets will be calculated too.<br/>False means all the formulas in the worksheet have been calculated and the values are right. |


## calculate_formula(recursive, ignore_error, custom_function) {#bool-bool-ICustomFunction}

Calculates all formulas in this worksheet.



```python
def calculate_formula(self, recursive, ignore_error, custom_function):
    ...
```


| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :- | :- | :- |
| recursive | bool | True means if the worksheet' cells depend on the cells of other worksheets,<br/>the dependent cells in other worksheets will be calculated too.<br/>False means all the formulas in the worksheet have been calculated and the values are right. |
| ignore_error | bool | Indicates if hide the error in calculating formulas.<br/>The error may be unsupported function, external links, etc. |
| custom_function | [ICustomFunction](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/icustomfunction) | The custom formula calculation functions to extend the calculation engine. |
