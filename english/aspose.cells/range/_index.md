## Range class

Encapsulates the object that represents a range of cells within a spreadsheet.



The Range type exposes the following members:

### Remarks 


The Range class denotes a region of Excel spreadsheet.
With this, you can format and set value of the range.
And you can simply copy range of Excel too.

### Example 


The following example shows how to create a range and set value the range of Excel.

```python
from aspose.cells import Workbook

# Instantiating a Workbook object
workbook = Workbook()
#  Get the first Worksheet Cells.
cells = workbook.worksheets[0].cells
#  Create a range (A1:D3).
range = cells.create_range("A1", "D3")
#  Set value to the range.
range.value = "Hello"
# Save the Excel file
workbook.save("book1.xlsm")

```
