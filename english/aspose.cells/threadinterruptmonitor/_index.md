## ThreadInterruptMonitor class

Simple implementation of [`AbstractInterruptMonitor`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/abstractinterruptmonitor) by starting another thread to require the interruption after sleeping user specified limit.



**Inheritance:** [`ThreadInterruptMonitor`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/threadinterruptmonitor) → 
[`AbstractInterruptMonitor`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/abstractinterruptmonitor)



The ThreadInterruptMonitor type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [__init__](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/threadinterruptmonitor/__init__/#bool) | Constructs one interruption monitor. |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [is_interruption_requested](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/threadinterruptmonitor/is_interruption_requested) | This implementation just checks whether the time cost(from the time when starting this monitor to now) is greater than user specified limit. |
| [terminate_without_exception](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/threadinterruptmonitor/terminate_without_exception) | See [`AbstractInterruptMonitor.terminate_without_exception`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/abstractinterruptmonitor#terminate_without_exception).<br/>This property is specified by user when constructing this monitor instance. |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [start_monitor](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/threadinterruptmonitor/start_monitor/#int) | Starts the monitor with the specified time limit. The start time to calculate time cost is just when this method is called,<br/>so the procedure which needs to be monitored should be started just after this call. |
| [finish_monitor](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/threadinterruptmonitor/finish_monitor/#) | Finishes the monitor for one procedure. |



### Remarks 


One monitor instance can be used repeatedly, as long as you monitor each process in sequence.
It should not be used to monitor multiple procedures concurrently in multi-threads.

### Example 


The following example shows how to monitor the load and save procedure with specified time limit:

```python
from aspose.cells import LoadOptions, ThreadInterruptMonitor, Workbook

monitor = ThreadInterruptMonitor(False)
lopts = LoadOptions()
lopts.interrupt_monitor = monitor
monitor.start_monitor(1000)
wb = Workbook("Large.xlsx", lopts)
# if the time cost of loading the template file exceeds one second, interruption will be required and exception will be thrown here
# otherwise finishes the monitor thread and starts to monitor the save procedure
monitor.finish_monitor()
monitor.start_monitor(1500)
wb.save("result.xlsx")
monitor.finish_monitor()

```
