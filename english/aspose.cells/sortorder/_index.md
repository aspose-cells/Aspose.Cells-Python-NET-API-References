## SortOrder enumeration

Represents sort order for the data range.



The SortOrder type exposes the following members:

### Fields
| Field | Description |
| :- | :- |
| ASCENDING | Sorts data in ascending order |
| DESCENDING | Sorts data in descending order |
| NATURAL | Keeps original data order without sorting. Only applies to some special scenarios such as PivotTable. |
