## number_category_type property


Represents the category type of this cell's number formatting.

### Remarks 


When cell's formatting pattern is combined with conditional formatting patterns,
then the returned type is corresponding to the part which is used for current value of this cell.
For example, if the formatting pattern for this cell is "#,##0;(#,##0);"-";@",
then when cell's value is numeric and not 0, the returned type is [`NumberCategoryType.NUMBER`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/numbercategorytype#NUMBER);
When cell's value is 0 or not numeric value, the returned type is [`NumberCategoryType.TEXT`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/numbercategorytype#TEXT).
