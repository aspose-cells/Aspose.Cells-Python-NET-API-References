## UnionRange class

Represents union range.



The UnionRange type exposes the following members:

| [refers_to](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/unionrange/refers_to) | Gets the range's refers to. |
| [has_range](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/unionrange/has_range) | Indicates whether this has range. |
| [hyperlinks](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/unionrange/hyperlinks) | Gets all hyperlink in the range. |
| [cell_count](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/unionrange/cell_count) | Gets all cell count in the range. |
| [range_count](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/unionrange/range_count) | Gets the count of the ranges. |
