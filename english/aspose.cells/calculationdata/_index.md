## CalculationData class

Represents the required data when calculating one function, such as function name, parameters, ...etc.



The CalculationData type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [calculated_value](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/calculationdata/calculated_value) | Gets or sets the calculated value for this function. |
| [workbook](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/calculationdata/workbook) | Gets the Workbook object where the function is in. |
| [worksheet](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/calculationdata/worksheet) | Gets the Worksheet object where the function is in. |
| [cell_row](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/calculationdata/cell_row) | Gets the row index of the cell where the function is in. |
| [cell_column](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/calculationdata/cell_column) | Gets the column index of the cell where the function is in. |
| [cell](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/calculationdata/cell) | Gets the Cell object where the function is in. |
| [function_name](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/calculationdata/function_name) | Gets the function name to be calculated. |
| [param_count](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/calculationdata/param_count) | Gets the count of parameters |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [get_param_value](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/calculationdata/get_param_value/#int) | Gets the represented value object of the parameter at given index. |
| [get_param_value_in_array_mode](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/calculationdata/get_param_value_in_array_mode/#int-int-int) | Gets the value(s) of the parameter at given index.<br/>If the parameter is some kind of expression that needs to be calculated,<br/>then it will be calculated in array mode. |
| [get_param_text](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/calculationdata/get_param_text/#int) | Gets the literal text of the parameter at given index. |



### Remarks 


All objects provided by this class are for "read" purpose only.
