## cell property


Gets the Cell object where the function is in.

### Remarks 


When calculating a formula without setting it to a cell,
such as by [`Worksheet.calculate_formula`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/worksheet/calculate_formula),
the formula will be calculated just like it has been set to cell A1,
so both [`CalculationData.cell_row`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/calculationdata#cell_row) and [`CalculationData.cell_column`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/calculationdata#cell_column) are 0.
However, cell A1 in the worksheet may has not been instantiated.
So for such kind of situation this property will be null.
### Definition:
```python
@property
def cell(self):
    ...
```
