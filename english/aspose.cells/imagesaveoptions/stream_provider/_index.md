## stream_provider property


Gets or sets the IStreamProvider for exporting objects.

### Remarks 


If saving as Tiff, this property is ignored.
Otherwise, if more than one image should be saving, we will write other images by this.
For advanced usage, please use [`WorkbookRender`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.rendering/workbookrender) or [`SheetRender`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells.rendering/sheetrender).
