## Validation class

Represents data validation.settings.



The Validation type exposes the following members:

### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [operator](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validation/operator) | Represents the operator for the data validation. |
| [alert_style](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validation/alert_style) | Represents the validation alert style. |
| [type](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validation/type) | Represents the data validation type. |
| [input_message](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validation/input_message) | Represents the data validation input message. |
| [input_title](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validation/input_title) | Represents the title of the data-validation input dialog box. |
| [error_message](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validation/error_message) | Represents the data validation error message. |
| [error_title](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validation/error_title) | Represents the title of the data-validation error dialog box. |
| [show_input](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validation/show_input) | Indicates whether the data validation input message will be displayed whenever the user selects a cell in the data validation range. |
| [show_error](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validation/show_error) | Indicates whether the data validation error message will be displayed whenever the user enters invalid data. |
| [ignore_blank](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validation/ignore_blank) | Indicates whether blank values are permitted by the range data validation. |
| [formula1](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validation/formula1) | Represents the value or expression associated with the data validation. |
| [formula2](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validation/formula2) | Represents the value or expression associated with the data validation. |
| [value1](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validation/value1) | Represents the first value associated with the data validation. |
| [value2](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validation/value2) | Represents the second value associated with the data validation. |
| [in_cell_drop_down](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validation/in_cell_drop_down) | Indicates whether data validation displays a drop-down list that contains acceptable values. |
| [areas](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validation/areas) | Gets all [CellArea](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cellarea) which contain the data validation settings. |


### Methods
| Method | Description |

| [get_formula2(is_r1c1, is_local, row, column)](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validation/get_formula2/#bool-bool-int-int) | Gets the value or expression associated with this validation for specific cell. |
| [add_area(cell_area)](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validation/add_area/#CellArea) | Applies the validation to the area. |
| [add_area(cell_area, check_intersection, check_edge)](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validation/add_area/#CellArea-bool-bool) | Applies the validation to the area. |
| [set_formula1(formula, is_r1c1, is_local)](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validation/set_formula1/#str-bool-bool) | Sets the value or expression associated with this validation. |
| [set_formula2(formula, is_r1c1, is_local)](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validation/set_formula2/#str-bool-bool) | Sets the value or expression associated with this validation. |
| [get_list_value(row, column)](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validation/get_list_value/#int-int) | Get the value for list of the validation for the specified cell. |
| [add_areas(areas, check_intersection, check_edge)](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validation/add_areas/#list-bool-bool) | Applies the validation to given areas. |
| [remove_area(cell_area)](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validation/remove_area/#CellArea) | Remove the validation settings in the range. |
| [remove_areas(areas)](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validation/remove_areas/#list) | Removes this validation from given areas. |
| [remove_a_cell(row, column)](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validation/remove_a_cell/#int-int) | Remove the validation settings in the cell. |
| [copy(source, copy_option)](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/validation/copy/#Validation-CopyOptions) | Copy validation. |



### Example 


```python
from aspose.cells import CellArea, OperatorType, ValidationType, Workbook

workbook = Workbook()
validations = workbook.worksheets[0].validations
area = CellArea.create_cell_area(0, 0, 1, 1)
validation = validations[validations.add(area)]
validation.type = ValidationType.WHOLE_NUMBER
validation.operator = OperatorType.BETWEEN
validation.formula1 = "3"
validation.formula2 = "1234"

```
