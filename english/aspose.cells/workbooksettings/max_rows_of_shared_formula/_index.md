## max_rows_of_shared_formula property


Gets and sets the max row number of shared formula.

### Remarks 


If the number is too large, the autofilter works very slow in MS Excel 2013.
### Definition:
```python
@property
def max_rows_of_shared_formula(self):
    ...
@max_rows_of_shared_formula.setter
def max_rows_of_shared_formula(self, value):
    ...
```
