## sheet_name property


Indicates which sheet this reference is in.

### Remarks 


If it references to multiple worksheets,
the returned value is just like the range expression in the formula.
For example "Sheet1:Sheet3" for the reference in formula "=SUM(Sheet1:Sheet3!$A$1:$B$2)".
### Definition:
```python
@property
def sheet_name(self):
    ...
```
