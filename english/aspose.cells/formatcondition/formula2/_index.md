## formula2 property


Gets and sets the value or expression associated with conditional formatting.

### Remarks 


Please add all areas before setting formula.
For setting formula for this condition, if the input value starts with '=', then it will be taken as formula.
Otherwise it will be taken as plain value(text, number, bool). For text value that starts with '=', user may input it as formula in format: "=\"=...\"".
