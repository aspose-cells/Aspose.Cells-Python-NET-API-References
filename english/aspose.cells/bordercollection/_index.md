```python
from aspose.cells import BorderType, CellBorderType, Workbook
from aspose.pydrawing import Color

# Instantiating a Workbook object
workbook = Workbook()
# Adding a new worksheet to the Excel object
workbook.worksheets.add()
# Obtaining the reference of the newly added worksheet by passing its sheet index
worksheet = workbook.worksheets[0]
# Accessing the "A1" cell from the worksheet
cell = worksheet.cells.get("A1")
# Adding some value to the "A1" cell
cell.put_value("Visit Aspose!")
style = cell.get_style()
# Setting the line style of the top border
style.borders.get(BorderType.TOP_BORDER).line_style = CellBorderType.THICK
# Setting the color of the top border
style.borders.get(BorderType.TOP_BORDER).color = Color.black
# Setting the line style of the bottom border
style.borders.get(BorderType.BOTTOM_BORDER).line_style = CellBorderType.THICK
# Setting the color of the bottom border
style.borders.get(BorderType.BOTTOM_BORDER).color = Color.black
# Setting the line style of the left border
style.borders.get(BorderType.LEFT_BORDER).line_style = CellBorderType.THICK
# Setting the color of the left border
style.borders.get(BorderType.LEFT_BORDER).color = Color.black
# Setting the line style of the right border
style.borders.get(BorderType.RIGHT_BORDER).line_style = CellBorderType.THICK
# Setting the color of the right border
style.borders.get(BorderType.RIGHT_BORDER).color = Color.black
cell.set_style(style)
# Saving the Excel file
workbook.save("book1.xls")
