### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [current_person](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/threadedcommentauthorcollection/current_person) | Gets and sets the current user. |
| [capacity](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/threadedcommentauthorcollection/capacity) | Gets or sets the number of elements that the array list can contain. |


### Methods
| Method | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`copy_to(self, array)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/threadedcommentauthorcollection/copy_to/#list) | Copies the entire array list to a compatible one-dimensional array list, starting at the beginning of the target array list. |
| [`copy_to(self, index, array, array_index, count)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/threadedcommentauthorcollection/copy_to/#int-list-int-int) | Copies a range of elements from the array list to a compatible one-dimensional array list, starting at the specified index of the target array list. |
| [`index_of(self, item, index)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/threadedcommentauthorcollection/index_of/#aspose.cells.threadedcommentauthor-int) | Searches for the specified object and returns the zero-based index of the first occurrence within the range of elements in the array list that extends from the specified index to the last element. |
| [`index_of(self, item, index, count)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/threadedcommentauthorcollection/index_of/#aspose.cells.threadedcommentauthor-int-int) | Searches for the specified object and returns the zero-based index of the first occurrence within the range of elements in the array list that starts at the specified index and contains the specified number of elements. |
| [`last_index_of(self, item)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/threadedcommentauthorcollection/last_index_of/#aspose.cells.threadedcommentauthor) | Searches for the specified object and returns the zero-based index of the last occurrence within the entire array list. |
| [`last_index_of(self, item, index)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/threadedcommentauthorcollection/last_index_of/#aspose.cells.threadedcommentauthor-int) | Searches for the specified object and returns the zero-based index of the last occurrence within the range of elements in the array list that extends from the first element to the specified index. |
| [`last_index_of(self, item, index, count)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/threadedcommentauthorcollection/last_index_of/#aspose.cells.threadedcommentauthor-int-int) | Searches for the specified object and returns the zero-based index of the last occurrence within the range of elements in the array list that contains the specified number of elements and ends at the specified index. |
| [`get(self, name)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/threadedcommentauthorcollection/get/#system.string) | Gets the person who create threaded comments. |
| [`add(self, name, user_id, provider_id)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/threadedcommentauthorcollection/add/#system.string-system.string-system.string) | Adds one thread comment person. |
| [`binary_search(self, item)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/threadedcommentauthorcollection/binary_search/#aspose.cells.threadedcommentauthor) | Searches the entire sorted array list for an element using the default comparer and returns the zero-based index of the element. |
