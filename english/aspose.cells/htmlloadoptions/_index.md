The HtmlLoadOptions type exposes the following members:

### Constructors
| Constructor | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [`__init__(self)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/htmlloadoptions/__init__/#) | Creates an options of loading the file. |
| [`__init__(self, load_format)`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/htmlloadoptions/__init__/#aspose.cells.loadformat) | Creates an options of loading the file. |


### Properties
| Property | Description |
| :- | :- |
| [load_format](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/htmlloadoptions/load_format) | Gets the load format. |
