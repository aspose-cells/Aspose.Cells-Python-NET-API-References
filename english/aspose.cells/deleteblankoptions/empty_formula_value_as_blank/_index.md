## empty_formula_value_as_blank property


Whether one cell will be taken as blank when it is formula and the calculated result is null or empty string. Default value is false.

### Remarks 


Generally user should make sure the formulas have been calculated before deleting operation with this property as true.
Otherwise all newly cretaed formulas by normal apis such as [`Cell.formula`](/cells/python-net/aspose.cells/cell#formula) will be taken as blank and may be deleted
because before calculation their calculated results are all null.
### Definition:
```python
@property
def empty_formula_value_as_blank(self):
    ...
@empty_formula_value_as_blank.setter
def empty_formula_value_as_blank(self, value):
    ...
```
