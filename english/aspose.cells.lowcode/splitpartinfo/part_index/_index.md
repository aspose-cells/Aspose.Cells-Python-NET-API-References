## part_index property


Index of current part in sequence(0 based).
-1 means there are no multiple parts so the result is single.

### Remarks 


If multiple sheets need to be processed and every sheet is processed(split)
separately, the part index always starts from 0 for every sheet.
For example, when converting workbook to images,
it represents the output page index of currently processed sheet.
And -1 denotes there is only one page for current sheet.
### Definition:
```python
@property
def part_index(self):
    ...
```
